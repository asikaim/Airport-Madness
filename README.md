# Airport-Madness
Part of Software Construction course 

A bit buggy Java clone of Airport Madness. There is no air collision because of original assignment, but that could be easily changed.
There are a lot of completely unnecessary asserts around the code, which was also part of our assignment.

Made in ~12 hours using LibGDX.
